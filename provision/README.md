# Provision Vulnerable Application

An application sometimes needs to be provisioned. I've taken some steps to try to make this as painless as possible. I also want to be able to test the Vulnerable Application's provisioning -- either done with something like a Vagrant file I plan on including in this repository, or something else, I just really want to be able to rest this. Something like serverspec could also be an option, but, ya' know. Things are things!


## info_mysql_server.rb           

Get information about a mysql server using ruby with this simple little tool.

## make_db_and_table_assigment.rb

Setup the vulnerable application mysql server to be the way we want it.
